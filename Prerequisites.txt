CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED
RESPONSES
Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.
Prerequisites:

Programming skills in Python, including control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP)
Understanding of Regular Expressions (Regex) for pattern matching
Familiarity with Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging
Steps to Develop a Chatbot:

Set up the development environment: Install Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.
Import necessary modules: Import NLTK, regular expressions, and other necessary modules.
Download NLTK datasets: Download the necessary datasets, including punkt for tokenization and averaged_perceptron_tagger for part-of-speech tagging.
Define patterns and responses: Define a list of patterns and corresponding responses using regular expressions.
Define the chatbot class: Create a class that encapsulates the functionality to handle user input and generate responses based on the defined patterns.
Initialize the chatbot: Instantiate the chatbot using the defined class and patterns.
Create a function to interact with the chatbot: Create a function that allows users to interact with the chatbot and receive responses.
Start the chat interaction: Invoke the chat interaction function to start chatting with the chatbot.
Complete Code: The complete code is provided to build a rule-based chatbot using Python and NLTK.

Conclusion: The integration of rule-based logic with NLP allows for the creation of sophisticated chatbots that can understand and respond to human queries effectively. By following these steps, developers can build chatbots that enhance user experience and contribute to operational efficiency.
